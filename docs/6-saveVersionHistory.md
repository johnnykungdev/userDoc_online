# Save To Version History

---

You can create and name new versions in your files. This is great for capturing a snapshot of the file at a specific time, or record a specific set of changes. You can add details to describe the changes you’ve made in this design iteration or any other details that may be relevant, like a milestone name or related task.

## Create a new version of a project

1.
**Open** the menu when inside of a project and **select** [Save to Version History].

**Tips**
- Figma cuts titles that are longer than 25 characters.
- To see the full description at a glance be sure to make your descriptions less than 140 characters.
- You can add URLs, but Figma will not turn them into clickable links.
