## Figma Website Cannot Be Reached

The error may occur due to server offline. Proceed to [figma status]([https://status.figma.com/](https://status.figma.com/)) to confirm the status of Figma server. If the server is down, please contact Figma through [figma support contact]([https://www.figma.com/contact/](https://www.figma.com/contact/)) to seek further support.

## Memory Usage Alert

The alert is caused by Figma occupying more memory than memory limitation in the browser. To reduce memory usage, there are multiple ways of resolving the issue.

1.
Remove Hidden Layers:
Find layers hidden in the Figma file. They use a large amount of memory in the browser. After finding the hidden layers, select it in the canvas or [Layers panel] then use the < Delete > or < Backspace > to delete it.

2.
Split files with images and pages:
Create a new file in the Figma account. **Select** the images and the components you want to move to another file. **Copy** and **Paste** them to the new file. Return to the original file and **delete** the images and components you moved.
