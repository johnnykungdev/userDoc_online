## Task 5: Connect The Pages

Once you are done creating elements and component, you can link elements to other pages by creating connections.

Connections help to visualize the actual flow of the project when prototyping.

1. **Click** on an element and **select** [Prototype]

2. **Click** the [+] icon on the top right corner then **select** where it says [Click â†’ None].
