# Build App Pages With Layer
{: .no_toc }

---

To start building a prototype of an application, you need to know the approximate number of the pages first. Pages are derived from your idea and can used to establish the major structure of an application. You will add pages using layers in Figma to the canvas and change the names to make the structure clear.

Layers are any frames, groups or objects created in the canvas area. They will be shown in the layer panel on the left of the page. Layers' kinds are indicated with different icons. The list of layers are as following:
