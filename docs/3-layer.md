## Task 3: Build App Pages With Layer

Layers are any frames, groups or objects created in the canvas area. They will be shown in the layer panel on the left of the page. Layers' kinds are indicated with different icons. The list of layers are as following:

The [Frame] layer will be used to create pages in Figma.

1.
**Open** the layer panel on the left of the page

To create a page-like layer, **Click** [Frame]. Then Move the mouse to the grey section of the Figma, which is the drawing area. **Click** on the starting point, then keep **Dragging** until the frame matches the expected size and shape.

5.
Upon successful creation, **click** either [Frame 1] on the layer panel or the frame in the canvas area to see its properties. The properties are shown in the property panel on the right side of the page. Height, width and other properties can be adjusted in the property panel.
