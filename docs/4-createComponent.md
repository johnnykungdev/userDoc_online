# Create Components On The Layout

After creating layers, we can add some components on to the layers.

Components are elements you can reuse across your designs. They help to create and manage consistent designs across projects.

You can create components from any layers or objects you've designed. These could be a whole range of things like buttons, icons, layouts, and more.

1. **Click** on the [Shape Tools] and you will see [Rectangle] has been selected by default.
