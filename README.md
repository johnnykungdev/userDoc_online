## Collaboration

Our team did some brainstorming and we came across Figma in our Web Development 2 course. We decided that it would benefit us and our class to make a user guide for Figma because we did not get enough practice time with the software in class.

We primarily used Discord for any means of real time communication and to share links. We had time in our Comm 2116 class when we were put into breakout rooms and this is when we got most of the content down. We each took a page or two to complete during our group meetings, we used class time mainly but towards the end we needed some extra time to figure out how to put it all together. We proof read simultaneously and separately to save time. 

We used the Visual Studio Code live share extension while coding our markdown together, this extension was a great help on keeping everyone on the same page and prevented our laptops from freezing due to non of us having to share our screens.

## Documentation Creation

We started by listing down the features that we think are essential for beginners to build the prototype they want. The decision was made to choose six basic functions to be elaborated in the documentation. Then we went through every feature by ourself, making sure we're familiar with the process and able to list down the steps required. We drafted our documents on Notion, since it's also collaborative and can be transferred to Markdown language easily. After most of the content is written, we created a repository on GitHub and used it to deploy a markdown file containing the content.

During the process, we made our text more concise and made our screenshots clear. Each set of instructions is related to the previous set and the next set provides users with a comprehensive understanding in building a prototype. We took advantage of Markdown that it is clear in hierarchy and easy to read, combined with Jekyll, a static-site generator, to create web pages on GitHub.

Template-wise, we chose the theme - Just The Docs, which is based on Jekyll and was suggested in our course Comm 2116. It's simple in design and provides clear navigation bar on the left. The users can easily direct to the desired section.

## Challenges

Throughout the process of creating the User Guide Document, we have faced a few obstacles we needed to overcome. The very first challenge was that the images(screenshots) we used were not showing up on the GitHub when we pushed our Markdown files. The problem was that we copied the image links from Notion, the tool we first used to collaborate, and images were stored in the Notion CDN. GitHub has no access to the Notion CDN therefore our images were left blank. To resolve this issue, our team saved all of our images in the repository so they can be properly loaded on GitHub.

Another problem we had to tackle was that we misunderstood the final document format that we needed to submit just one day before it was due. We have worked for weeks and the amount of content we have created was enormous. Our team gathered online and spent the entire day to convert to proper format. Luckily, these situations were not extremely problematic however they could have been avoided if we managed the assignment more carefully.
